# PowerShell Password Generator

This PowerShell script is designed to fetch and generate secure passwords using the XKPasswd service, an online tool for creating memorable yet secure passwords based on the XKCD comic's password strength concept. This script communicates with the XKPasswd server, requests a password with specific criteria, and then copies the generated password to the clipboard for user convenience.

## How It Works

The script performs a POST request to the XKPasswd server with specific parameters that define the criteria for the generated password. It then processes the server's response to extract the generated password and copies it to the clipboard.
